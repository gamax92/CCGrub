CCGrub
==========

A ComputerCraft BIOS replacement built to be visually similar to Grub4DOS

Of course, since Grub4DOS is for actual machines and CCGrub is for ComputerCraft-LuaJ, things won't be the same.

Compression:
------------

The build scripts provided support compressing the generated bios.lua if LuaSrcDiet is provided.

Download LuaSrcDiet-0.11.2 and place the folder in the same location as the build scripts.
